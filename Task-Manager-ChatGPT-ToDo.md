## üß© Implementation Tips & Tech Suggestions
- For background jobs: use **Celery + Redis** (Python) or **BullMQ / Agenda** (Node) or simple cron for lightweight tasks.
- For file storage: prefer **S3-compatible** storage for production; keep `uploads/` for local dev.
- For OAuth: use **Passport.js** (Node) or **python-social-auth / Authlib** (Python) or **NextAuth** (Next.js).
- For notifications: Web Push (VAPID) for browsers; use Firebase Cloud Messaging for mobile.
- For scheduling reminders: worker queue + task scheduler (Celery beat, bullcron, or cronjobs).
- Use JWT carefully: add refresh tokens and allow token revocation (store refresh tokens in DB).

## ‚úÖ Suggested Implementation Order (Roadmap)
1. Add tags/categories + priority (quick UX improvement).  
2. Add subtasks & comments (improves task expressiveness).  
3. Add attachments + input validation.  
4. Add scheduled email reminders (background worker).  
5. Implement OAuth login + password reset.  
6. Add calendar & Kanban views.  
7. Add tests, CI, and OpenAPI docs.  
8. Add analytics / exports / multi-tenant if needed.

## üì¶ Quick checklist for making repo production-ready
- [ ] Clear README with setup (Docker + env variables example)
- [ ] `.env.example` with required vars (no secrets)
- [ ] LICENSE file (e.g., MIT)
- [ ] GitHub Actions badge in README for CI
- [ ] Release with Docker image or small deploy guide
